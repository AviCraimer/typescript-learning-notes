# Typescript Learning Notes
There are my notes and code examples when I was learning TypeScript and leading a TypeScript study group from 2020-2021 when I worked at CBC Digital Products.

Note, most of the code is not meant to be run, but rather to illustrate how the type checking works. I recomment using VSCode so you can see the type errors visually overlayed with the code.
